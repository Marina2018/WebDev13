						<br>
						<p>Christian Radich in 1956.

In 1956, the first race of the sail training Tall Ships took place and we’re celebrating our diamond anniversary this year.

The race took place from Torbay, UK to Lisbon, Portugal, and it was organised by the Sail Training International Race Committee (STRC).

It was supposed to be a celebration of the world’s remaining magnificent Class A Tall Ships – everyone thought they were close to retirement. But things didn’t quite go as everyone expected… in the best way possible.

The event was so incredibly popular that STRC decided to make it biennial. They wanted to encourage friendly rivalry amongst seafaring young people, while giving them the opportunity to develop themselves through sail training.

During these early days, the UK’s Duke of Edinburgh became a Patron. As a result, a new association was born: the Sail Training Association (STA). STA organised a number of successful races – with as many as six square-riggers and up to 27 smaller vessels entering.

						<p class="title_2">What We Do</p>
						<br>
						<p>
We’re a registered charity. This means that we’re not out to make a profit – we’re trying to get as many people as possible on board a sail training Tall Ship. To achieve this, we work closely with the world’s sail training vessels, National Sail Training Organisations (NSTOs), and host ports. We arrange lots of events and work with our members from around the world.
<br>
Our activities include:
<br>
Planning Races, Regattas and other events for sail training Tall Ships.
Organising conferences and seminars.
Publishing leaflets and books.
Undertaking international research.
Supporting the Ships Council (whose membership of the Tall Ships Forum and Small Ships Forum are the operators of many of the world’s sail training tall ships).
Promoting Sail Training International Youth (whose members are under the age of 26 and represent the interests of young sail trainers around the world).
Check out our events for more on our Races and Regattas.

						<p class="title_2">What Are The Tall Ships Races?</p>
						<br>
						<p>
We can help you to get involved with lots of different sail training adventures around the world. However, the biggest one that we organise is the Tall Ships Races. This spectacular, annual event is aimed at young people (16-25 years old) and it takes place in European waters over the summer months.

We start planning the Tall Ships Races four years in advance. We carefully select the route, so that the fleet can visit different sea areas around Europe… everywhere from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. After all, we want as many different people as possible to experience an adventure under sail.

Once we’ve decided on the region, we invite ports to bid to become host ports. Host ports play a really important role in the Tall Ships Races – we couldn’t do it without them. So, of course, we want to make sure that they’re up to the task. We want to ensure that the event is a success for them, too.

Huge crowds visit the host ports during the four days of the Tall Ships Races. We’ve seen hundreds of thousands of people at events… sometimes even several million.

Once the host ports are on board, we invite the world’s Tall Ships to take part. Everything from the biggest Class As (barques, brigs and ship rigged) to the smallest Class Ds (sloops, ketches and schooners). After the impressive fleet is assembled, we need to find the crew to sail them. That’s where you come in. </p>
